Project Title: Woodinn Home – Ecommerce Platform UI/UX
Description: Woodinn Home is a home and electrical retail company in Nsawam, Ghana. They want a modern, trustworthy, mobile-friendly ecommerce web app so that local customers can buy home goods, furniture, electrical appliances, etc., online. The UI/UX should help increase trust, make shopping fast/easy, reduce friction, and reflect local identity and values.

Target Users:
• Local residents of Nsawam / Eastern Region who may prefer in-person shopping but want convenience.
• Users with mid-level connectivity (mobile networks) and mobile devices being a primary access point.

Typography: clear, legible, modern but friendly

Imagery: high quality product photography; lifestyle images showing items in real homes (especially local settings)

UI elements (buttons, cards, icons): clean design, intuitive, easy to tap on mobile

Visual signals of trust: security badges, customer testimonials, verified reviews

Use local motifs subtly (patterns or textures) to create connection without making design look busy.

Ensure site loads well even on slower mobile networks

Responsive design: works smoothly on phones, tablets, desktops

Accessibility: readable font sizes, contrast, alt text for images, keyboard-accessible where possible

Deliverables:

Wireframes (mobile + desktop)

High-fidelity mockups (desktop + mobile) + interactive prototype (Figma / Adobe XD / Sketch)

Design system / style guide: colours, typography, spacing, components

UI assets: buttons, icons, image placeholders, etc.

Optional: user flow diagrams, usability test plan, suggestions for iteration based on feedback
